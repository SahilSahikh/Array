# Array

Welcome to the **Array** repository! This repository, maintained by **Sahil Shaikh**, contains a collection of C programs that focus on solving various problems related to arrays. The goal is to provide efficient solutions with clear explanations for each array-related problem.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by different array problems, each with its own folder containing:

- The C program implementing the solution.
- Detailed descriptions of the problem.
- Sample inputs and outputs to demonstrate the program's functionality.
- Step-by-step explanations of the algorithm used.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SahilSahikh/Array.git
   ```

2. **Explore the programs**: Navigate to different folders to explore the array problems and their solutions.

3. **Compile and run the programs**: Each program can be compiled and executed using GCC. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ./program_name
   ```

## Programs Included

This repository includes a variety of array-related programs, such as:

- Finding the third largest element in an array.
- Sorting arrays using different algorithms.
- Searching for elements in arrays.
- Performing various operations like rotation, reversal, and merging of arrays.

Each program is designed to be educational, with emphasis on clear, optimized solutions.
